O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't, ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely.
